As a system,
I want to scan all local images and compute stable content hashes,
So that local files can be used as the source of truth for comparison.

Acceptance Criteria
Functional

System scans local directories recursively

Only supported image formats are processed (jpg, png, jpeg, heic, webp)

Each file produces:

file path

size (bytes)

hash (MD5 or SHA-256)

Hashing is performed using streaming (chunk-based) IO

Hashes are cached to avoid reprocessing unchanged files

Non-Functional

No file is fully loaded into memory

System handles ≥100 GB datasets without failure

Hash computation is deterministic and repeatable

SOLID Mapping

SRP: LocalScanner + HashService

DIP: Hash algorithm injected via interface
